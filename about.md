Hi, I'm Caity. While earning my Ph.D. in Ecology at the University of California, Davis, I write on a variety of topics ranging from the intersection of ecology and agriculture, world travels, and the great outdoors to ruminations on science, policy, food systems, and nature.

In my spare time I am a freelance science writer and editor working in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Feel free to [contact me ](mailto:ca.peterson32@gmail.com) or check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caityp/) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caitlin_Peterson2?ev=hdr_xprf) profiles for more info.

Hi, I'm Caity. I have worked around the world, whether as an agroforestry intern in rural Guatemala or a seasonal ranch hand in Australia. I earned my Ph.D. in Ecology and Master's in International Agricultural Development at the University of California, Davis. My research topics have spanned climate-smart agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa and Colombia, precision agriculture in almond orchards in the Central Valley of California, and beef-soybean cover crop grazing systems in Brazil. I write on a variety of topics ranging from the intersection of ecology and agriculture, world travels, and the great outdoors to ruminations on science, policy, food systems, and nature.

In my spare time I am a freelance science writer and editor working in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Feel free to [contact me ](mailto:ca.peterson32@gmail.com) or check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caityp/) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caitlin_Peterson2?ev=hdr_xprf) profiles for more info.
